        "description": "One of the key insights from the study is the importance of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Black-box ML models, while powerful, are often criticized for their lack of interpretability. XAI techniques are helping bridge this gap, making predictions more transparent and actionable for decision-makers. This is particularly crucial in flood management, where trust in model outputs directly influences policy and emergency response.",
        "content": "With climate change intensifying the frequency of extreme weather events, traditional methods are not enough to mitigate flood risks. To address this crisis, researchers have published a comprehensive review that could redefine how communities prepar... [5094 chars]",
