        "description": "**media[903958]**KOTA DELTAMAS, Indonesia, Jan. 19, 2026  /PRNewswire/ -- In an era of rising operational complexity and global competition, digital transformation has become a critical catalyst for industrial growth. Industry data confirms that integrated monitoring systems significantly boost efficiency, bolster security, and empower leadership with real-time, data-driven insights. To meet these evolving demands, PT Samakta Mitra-an IT solutions provider and subsidiary of Sinar Mas Land-has partnered with NEC Indonesia to establish a state-of-the-art Smart City Command Center within the Greenland International Industrial Center (GIIC) at Kota Deltamas. The Smart City Command Center at Deltamas Industrial Estate functions as an integrated monitoring and control center, offering real-time visibility and accuracy over field operations. By synthesizing data from an extensive network of CCTV cameras, traffic management systems, and environmental sensors, the center provides a comprehensive visualization of the estate's status. This integrated approach ensures that decision-making-whether for routine operations or critical emergency response-is standardized, rapid, and data-backed. Key features include advanced hazard alerts, such as landslide and flood detection, alongside proactive traffic and security monitoring to ensure a secure industrial environment.",
