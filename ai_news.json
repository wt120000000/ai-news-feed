BRATISLAVA, Slovakia, Aug. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ESET researchers have uncovered a new type of ransomware that leverages generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to execute attacks. Named PromptLock, the malware runs a locally accessible AI language model to generate malicious scripts in real time. During infection, the AI autonomously decides which files to search, copy, or encrypt - marking a potential turning point in how cybercriminals operate.",
