As the global race for AI dominance intensifies, China is carving out a distinct lead in one critical arena: the integration of AI with industrial manufacturing. This is propelled by a clear national strategy. While the U.S. pours vast resources into AIGC (AI-Generated Content) and foundational model research, China is executing a determined, policy-driven push for 'AI+Industrial Manufacturing.' The result is a pivotal divergence: as the U.S. explores AI's creative frontiers, China is systematically deploying it to solidify its position as the world's workshop.",
