The artificial intelligence model found that behaviors of natural reward-seeking behavior and lower sociability in adolescent mice were each predictive of a likelihood to seek out alcohol. The study, published in Alcohol: Clinical and Experimental Research, suggests that certain neurochemical pathways in the adolescent brain may be associated with susceptibility to alcohol consumption and misuse, and may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention in teens at risk for alcohol use disorder.",
