Today, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6% as traders piled back into artificial intelligence stocks after a wave of major AI announcements. The S&P 500 added 0.2%. Amazon soared 4% on a $38 billion OpenAI deal. Nvidia climbed 2% as it expanded its UAE investment to $15.2 billion. Micron jumped 4%. AI stocks are leading the charge again. The Nasdaq rose 0.6%, while the S&P 500 added 0.2%. But the rallys getting narrow — more than 400 S&P 500 stocks fell Monday. Still, with 80% of Q3 earnings beating estimates, bulls see room to run.",
