        "description": "A major assessment by the Gesellschaft für Informatik argues that artificial intelligence has become planetary-scale infrastructure whose environmental harms are systemic, arising not just from energy use but from power concentration, weak governance, rebound effects, and deep integration into economic and ecological systems. Without precautionary governance, transparency, and limits aligned with planetary boundaries, AI risks reinforcing ecological degradation rather than helping to solve it.",
