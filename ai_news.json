While the study, titled 'Beyond Productivity: Measuring the Real Value of AI,' found that 85% of employees report saving between one and seven hours per week using AI tools, nearly 40% of those time savings are currently being lost to rework. This loss stems from employees having to fix mistakes, rewrite content, and verify outputs from generic AI tools, creating what the report describes as a 'false sense of productivity'.",
