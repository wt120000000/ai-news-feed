The new platform automates the development of digital twins, which are virtual replicas of production lines, to optimise plant operations, detect anomalies early, and support data-driven decision-making.   The technology has shown key advantages of an ontology-based digital twin to improve system understanding, refine predictions, and supports the addition of flexible, new workflow agents for future digital development and manufacturing.",
