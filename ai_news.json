The study explains how AI helps overcome several challenges in implementing quantum technologies, particularly in the compilation and execution of quantum circuits. Quantum-circuit compilation is critical for mapping algorithms onto real quantum hardware, which is often constrained by noise and limited qubit connectivity. AI-driven algorithms, including reinforcement learning and graph neural networks, have shown the potential to optimize qubit routing and minimize error accumulation during execution.",
