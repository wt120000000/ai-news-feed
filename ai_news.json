        "description": "Researchers have harnessed the power of artificial intelligence to tackle one of the most complex challenges in immunology: predicting how T cells recognize and respond to specific peptide antigens. Using AlphaFold 3 (AF3), an AI/ML model, designed for protein structure prediction, the team demonstrated a novel approach to model T cell receptor–peptide/major histocompatibility complex (TCR-pMHC) interactions with growing accuracy. The paper is published in the journal Frontiers in Immunology.",
