        "description": "UNESCO’s report argues that artificial intelligence cannot be governed with traditional, one-time regulatory checks, and that supervisory authorities must instead build continuous, learning-based institutions capable of interpreting AI behaviour in real-world contexts. It concludes that capacity building, through tools like observatory units, monitoring systems, and regulatory sandboxes is the key to making AI oversight effective, trustworthy, and aligned with public values.",
