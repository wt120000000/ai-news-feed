In this new epistemic framework, truth is no longer the result of human debate, evidence weighing, and institutional vetting. Instead, it emerges from the inner workings of probabilistic models, pattern recognition systems, and data pipelines. These systems rely on vast training datasets, algorithmic proxies, and optimization objectives to determine credibility and accuracy.",
