While the United States leaves matters largely to market forces, the European Union relies on extensive regulatory compliance and China on concentrated state authority. But none of these are a realistic option if you are among the many countries that must govern artificial intelligence (AI) without large regulatory structures or massive computing capacity. Instead, we need a different framework, one that embeds transparency, consent and accountability directly into digital infrastructure.",
