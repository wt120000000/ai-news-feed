Unlike UPI's standardized payment system, AI evolved through complex global supply chains involving multiple components. The piece cites failed US semiconductor controls on China as evidence that centralized approaches don't work, as Chinese firms adapted by reconfiguring supply chains. The authors warn against India's 'national champions' approach, suggesting AI sovereignty requires global participation rather than administrative control.",
