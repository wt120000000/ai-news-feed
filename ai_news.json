        "description": "Analysis challenges applying India's UPI success model to AI development, arguing that state-led compute provisioning and centralized control could stall innovation. Unlike UPI's standardized payment system, AI evolved through complex global supply chains involving multiple components. The piece cites failed US semiconductor controls on China as evidence that centralized approaches don't work, as Chinese firms adapted by reconfiguring supply chains. The authors warn against India's 'national champions' approach, suggesting AI sovereignty requires global participation rather than administrative control.",
