        "description": "Apropos of ‘2025: The year of Trumpism’; President Trump’s policies on trade, tariffs, immigration, artificial intelligence and defence have caused desperation and disappointment among US citizens. His pronouncements regarding the global situation have found no encouragement among world leaders. His soft attitude towards China and Russia have not produced any tangible results either in achieving peace. The National Security Strategy seems unviable and very expensive. Nor does it have any positive effect on international diplomatic and military scenario. It will be interesting to see how Trump shapes the future domination of the US although his MAGA policy has failed to achieve significant prosperity and welfare of Americans.",
